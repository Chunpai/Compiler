This folder contain 4 files:
1. README: this file
2. input_file: contains arithematic expression to be calculated
3. tokenizer.py: scan and tokenize the input_file into tokens
4. calculator.py: get tokens from tokenizer and use LL(1) grammer with action routine 
                  to paese and evaluate the expression.

How to run this program:
        "python calculator.py input_file"
        

Descriptions:
This program will scan the arithmatic expression stored in the input_file,
and tokenize the expression into several tokens.
And then it implements the LL(1) parsing with action routine to do the 
parsing and evaluation, without building a real parse tree.
